This repository follows Bai, Bali and Wen (2019) and Dick-Nielsen (2009) to clean the intraday Enhanced TRACE Corporate Bond Database, compute bond accrued interest, 
bond full price and other bond characteristics. The final part of the repository replicates the BBW 4-Factor model using the processed Enhanced TRACE data.
The script files start by processing the bond data from intraday -> daily.
Thereafter, bond accrued interest and the dirty price is computed on each and every day there is a valid bond trade.
From then then on, script files are provided to compute bond amount outstanding , bond rating and the other necessary bond characteristics which
are required as inputs to the BBW 4-Factor model (95% VaR, and the ILLIQ proxy from "The Illiquidity of Corporate Bonds" by Bao, Pan, and Wang, 2011).

The code is in Python and borrows heavily from Qingyi (Freda) Song Drechsler's SAS code which is available via WRDS here:
https://wrds-www.wharton.upenn.edu/pages/support/manuals-and-overviews/wrds-bond-return/cleaning-trace-data/wrds-clean-trace-enhanced-file/

There are clear differences, however, between this code and the code (in SAS) that is available on WRDS.
This code is made publicly available to encourage replicability in empirical asset pricing papers that use the Enhanced TRACE database.
As such, the output of this code should then be used in conjuction with my other repositories to replicate the BBW 2019 paper.

Intraday Filtering:
This code filters out bonds according to the intraday BBW 2019 filters: See Page 5/24 of the JFE version.

4. Remove bonds that trade under $5 or above $1000

7. For intraday data, we also eliminate bond transactions 
that are labeled as when-issued, locked-in, or have special 
sales conditions, and that have more than a twoday settlement.

8. Remove transaction records that are canceled and adjust records that are subsequently corrected or reversed.
This component explicitly uses the approach opf Dick-Nielsen (2009, 2014)

9. Remove transaction records that have trading volume less than $10,000

The other relavent filters use the Mergent FISD corporate bond database (included in the code).

The file outputs equally-weighted and volume-weighted prices and bond volume in a compressed .csv file.
